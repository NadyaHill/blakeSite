        <h1>Welcome to Native Electric of Hostetler Construction</h1>
        <p>With more than seven years of experience working from Castle Rock to Thornton and specializing in the suburbs south of Denver, we pride ourselves on doing honest work for honest pay.  Quality labor isn’t cheap and cheap labor isn’t quality, but that doesn’t mean you need to pay an arm and a leg to have a light replaced!
        </p>
        <p>Our experienced, friendly and knowledgeable electricians are dedicated to meeting the needs of every client, regardless of the size of the job. We are also willing to give free estimates.
        </p>
        <p>Every visit with Native Electric is blocked in two hour periods and in most cases, will be completed in one visit. However, if you need more then two hours on your first visit, that's OK! We understand you have a tight schedule and don’t expect you to work around us.
        <p>I have been a single parent since I was nineteen, and have worked very hard to accomplish my dreams of buying a house and giving my son the life he deserves.  This drive to succeed and make friends and business partners along the way has given me a business ethic that is difficult to find elsewhere— I respect your time and can offer you the best price, and best work, guaranteed!
        </p>
        <p>Call or <a href="mailto:nmhmusic@gmail.com?Subject=Hello%20I'm%20interested%20in%20Native%20Electric" target="_top">email</a> today and we can discuss your needs and viable solutions. Thank you for your business!
        </p>
